# 🧠 Projects by Hossain

A personal collection of software experiments, logic simulators, low-level libraries, and tools. Many of these came from curiosity, late-night inspiration, or the desire to deeply understand what’s under the hood.

## 🧩 Systems & Simulation

### 🔢 [CordicSim](#)
Full-mode CORDIC simulator using fixed-point arithmetic.  
Built to test trigonometric and hyperbolic operations in Q-format arithmetic.

### 💡 [CordicV](#)
A Verilog implementation of the CORDIC algorithm, with pipelined and shared stage versions.  
Great for FPGA designs or anyone learning about hardware-efficient math computation.

### 🧮 [FixedSim](#)
C++ library for simulating Q<m,n> fixed-point arithmetic.  
Designed for precision-critical digital logic simulations and embedded applications.

### ⚙️ [MipSim](#)
A real-time, gate-level multi-cycle MIPS pipeline emulator.  
Useful for understanding pipelining, hazards, and instruction execution at the hardware level.

## 🛠 Hardware Logic & RTL

### 🧾 [SimpleMachine](#)
A Verilog-based abstract machine that executes basic operations in internal registers.  
Excellent for experimenting with state transitions and control logic.

### 🧰 [SimKT](#)
Real-time logic gate simulator written in Kotlin for the JVM.
