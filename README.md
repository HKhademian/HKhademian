### 👋 Hello!
# I'm Hossain

A curious mind with an engineer's mindset — I build systems that work, scale, and respect user privacy.  
Currently working on clean backend architectures, tuning systems on linux vps, and mentoring the next generation of devs.

### 🧠 A Bit About Me

- 💻 Software Engineer: with a fluid style, I move easily between stacks, tools, and mindsets.
- 🔨 I write code — cross-stack, mostly backend, mostly clean, sometimes weird.
- 🛠️ I believe in deep focus, and solving real problems.
- 🔧 I care deeply about **clean code**, **minimalism**, and **systems that don’t leak** (data or memory).
- 🧪 I learn by doing: break → build → repeat.
- 🧭 Fast learner, problem solver, and experiment freak — I believe learning never stops.
- 🌍 I care a lot about privacy, open systems, and tech that respects people.
- 🌍 Live in Germany 🇩🇪 — working in Telecom infrastructure.
- ☕ Coffee helps. So does walking.

### 🧓 Some big words

"Technology should empower, not extract."

"Code is poetry when it’s honest."

"Learn constantly. Help generously."
