### 👋 Hello!
# I'm Hossain

A curious mind with an engineer's discipline — I build systems that work, scale, and respect user privacy.  
Currently crafting clean backend architectures, tuning systems on Debian boxes, and mentoring the next generation of devs.

### 🧭 About Me

- 💻 Software Engineer: with a fluid style, I move easily between stacks, tools, and mindsets.
- 🌍 Based in Germany — building privacy-aware infrastructure and open tools.
- 🧪 Fast learner, problem solver, and experiment freak — I believe learning never stops.
- 🔧 I care deeply about **clean code**, **minimalism**, and **systems that don’t leak** (data or memory).
